# erlgame

I wonder what it would be like to code up some simple game rules in [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/)

## Description

Currently, all functionality exists in the `world` app. You can create an `area` and connect them with a `connection`.

## Usage

```shell script
rebar3 release && rebar3 shell
```

## Dependencies

- [rebar3](https://github.com/erlang/rebar3)
